      <summary>What are the differnet types of bread?</summary>
      <p>There are basically three main types of bread, those that are baked in pans because they rise the highest, those that have a medium rise, therefore are baked on cookie sheets or stones such as French breads, some types of Italian and rye breads. The third type are ones that have almost no rise and they are called flatbreads.</p>

       <summary>Make sure the yeast is still active</summary>
      <p>The yeast you are using could be old or dead, to tell if the yeast is still active, in a small bowl add a 1/2 cup of water, sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons of yeast and a pinch of sugar over the top, stir it up, then let it stand for about 5 minutes.<br/>If the yeast is still active, it will dissolve completely into the water and the liquid will start bubbling.
        Make sure your water isn't too hot or too cold. Too hot and you will kill the yeast, too cold and it will take a long time for the dough to rise. The perfect temperature is 100-110F.</p>

      <summary>How do you know when the bread is done?</summary>
      <p>There are three ways to tell when the bread is done, the first is by looking at the colour of the bread, which is usually a light to dark golden brown (depending on the bread), the second is by knocking on the bottom of the bread, if there is a hollow sound it usually means the bread is done and the third is by the internal temperature which should be 190F (88C) or 200F (93C) for Brioche type breads.</p>

      <summary>What is the best flour to use</summary>
      <p>I personally use all purpose but if you prefer bread flour works just as well, some people swear by it.It will give your dough a chewier and denser bread.</p>
